# INFO263-Project
This is our INFO263 Repository
The purpose of designing this interface is to support staff from the UC School of Mathematics & Statistics in managing event activities. In addition, the interface consists of several pages including a login page, home page, create event page, a past events and a future events page. This interface enables users to easily view current, past and future events as well as create new events in a simplistic one step process.

Our interface was styled using the Bootstrap Library, jQuery library and AJAX library as well as our own CSS documents. Our interface was designed using PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and SQL. Stored procedures have been used to link the database with our interface.
